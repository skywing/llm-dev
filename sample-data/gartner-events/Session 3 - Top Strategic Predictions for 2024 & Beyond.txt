seing darl plumber do this talk we worked on it for a year I know he's disappointed that he couldn't be here
with you you've got little oh me instead that being said when we were
titling this talk the year everything changed does that feel like it's
hyperbole does it feel like we're making an exaggeration I don't know I mean there is a certain kind of part of our
business model that is to scare the heck out of you guys so that you'll buy more Gartner licenses
I get that that's fair but as I think about it I think in
20 25 years when we look back we are going to think that this is the year
that everything changed I don't think that's an exaggeration and and my part of this story actually starts last year
I was uh part of the keynote team for Gartner security and risk conference in National Harbor DC where we had a AI
fighting AI on stage in this live red team blue team scenario that was just
fabulous the production values were amazing the number one piece of feedback we got from that
audience it was too futuristic it's too futuristic fast forward to November of
2022 open AI released chat GPT and I don't know if any of us feel
like that Future's too future F istic anymore I don't think it feels like science fiction in fact I think for a
lot of us it might feel like we're this skier we're on this hill and generative
AI is this slippery slope and and we're concerned are we
going to unleash this slippery slope on on the village down below who are who are our customers who are our our our
citizens who are our employees and for us I'm not going to so
a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt with you here today even though I'm a practitioner in our cyber security
research practice and I know cesos that's what we exist to do but that's not what I'm here to do today I'm here
to help us plot a course down that Hill because often the
softest powder is through the trees right not on the well-worn runs and it
is through that path perhaps that more difficult path that less Worn Path that we're going to find a route to the
bottom where everyone prospers our citizens our
employees and our shareholders now thinking about
prospering when we develop this talk every year and it takes about a year for
us to do it we get about 200 submissions for possible top predictions
so we thought to ourselves maybe we could make our jobs easier maybe we could ask generative AI itself what it
thinks the prediction should be so we
did and here are two by 2026 virtual and augmented reality will
Top 10 Predictions
be used to create immersive learning and allow more realistic learning
paths or by 2026 30% of workers will leverage
digital Charisma filters to achieve previously unattainable advances in their
careers who thinks it's the first one who thinks generative AI generated
the first one who thinks the second one is is is a generative
AI all right that's pretty good that's pretty good I think they're both pretty nice but if I was going to do the
reveal I feel like the second one's got maybe a little bit more data a little bit more actionability to it perhaps
that's really what we go for when we're trying to develop these not that every prediction is going to come true not
that every prediction is Right Gartner predictions are really about understanding Trends and
velocities not about looking in a crystal ball trying to anticipate what the future
is so without any further Ado I'm going to throw the top 10 predicts up on the screen so that you all can take pictures
of it if you like and we're going to roll on with our story here's the first
five and the second
five we're going to unfold our story today in three parts part one is about
how generative AI is going to make us all individually better part two is how it's going to
help our organizations our businesses and Enterprise overcome their worst
traits and part three is going to to be about threats and opportunities and responsibilities but really about the
ability to develop new communities so for our first part
generative AI making us more powerful personally and professionally we're at an interesting inflection point right
now we're just coming out of coid we've got a lot of remote work going on and for the first time in human history
there's a Technology Innovation that's going to benefit individual workers sure
Technology's taken a lot of The Drudge work out of the work that our workers do every day but the people who typically
profit from that are management or the Enterprises themselves but with generative AI with remote work we have
the ability to LIT individuals profit from Innovations and
Technology free up time become better at what they do maybe even spend a little
bit more time with their families they can realize the value and that's a really unique opportunity for us generative AI
has the ability to help us write better it has the ability to to help us uh engage with our customers more
intimately it has the ability to make us more
AI has the ability to make us more charismatic
charismatic by 20 this this this prediction comes to comes to us from our my dear friends Rita Salam and Whit
Andrews by 2026 AI will make us seem better than we are that 30% of workers
will leverage digital Charisma filters to achieve previously unattainable advances in their
careers what's a Charisma filter you've been on Instagram
right all right well that was super funny in my head because I don't think anybody on Instagram or Tik Tok is anything other than filtered and it's
not just like Blurry images of pretty people dancing in front of cute dogs that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the ability to
increase your presence in the spoken word increase your presence in the written word increase your presence in
your organization virtually we're talking about well let me ask
you I think I'm a pretty charismatic dude in my native
English would I get the same response though if this stage were in Japan and
you all were listening to me translated through a translator no I don't think so but with
Charisma filters that can become true we're already seeing Tech technology from organizations like Nvidia which
will adjust your eyelines you're always looking right down the barrel of the camera that will skinny you up or make
you look a little bit prettier by way of research I went and got one of those cameras that'll you know make us look a
lot skinnier and make us look a lot more attractive um it was unable to make any significant difference in my appearance
which I'm going to go probably suggest that I'm probably just a little bit beyond any kind of real hope here I
don't know but digital Charisma filter are going to help us and our organizations achieve new sort of
personal Heights it will help us achieve new levels of personal
performance it's also going to become an indicator of national
performance what do I mean by that well let me ask you another question do you think lonstein could ever rise to
challenge China China's great superpower has been
people there's 1.4 some odd billion Chinese and they have been amazing at
leveraging Talent over the past 60 or 70 years this is genuinely been their National superpower as Talent well with
AI as long as you have enough gpus and electricity you have the ability to make
unlimited amounts of talent unlimited amounts of talent and I don't know if that's going to be true for lonstein but
it could certainly become true for my home state of Texas we could take all that place we tend to
keep all of our cows just covered up in solar panels and gpus and suddenly we've got an unlimited Talent base that we can
use and I believe small states like Australia or what have you will be able to rise and become AI superpowers this
particular prediction comes to us from Julian sun and Sana secular by 2027 productivity value of AI will be
recognized as a primary indicator of National Power we already use a we already use
indicators of productivity GDP individual productivity organizational productivity as a source of Power by
making it a national Benchmark by making it something that we report on as Nations this will cause greater
investment it will speed this transformation into a world where we all
Prosper prediction number three by 2027 25% of Fortune 500
Neurodiversity and cognitive diversity are superpowers
companies will actively recruit neurodiverse Talent across conditions like autism ADHD dyslexia to improve
business performance quick question if anybody out there can anybody tell based on
these pictures here who's neurodiverse no no that's kind of part
of the issue by the way just as an aside I think every picture in this deck except for one was generated by
generative AI your challenge is to go home and figure out which ones but no you can't tell who's
neurodiverse just by looking at them and I think this is an important part of the
point is that really neurodiversity and cognitive diversity are superpowers for
organizations when you have cognitively diverse people they see problems in different ways they see opportunities in
different ways and they will create different ways to engage with each other to engage with customers to engage with citizens to engage with fellow employees
to unlock new sources of value and to kind of put a little bit of
a a Capstone on this point and speaking is somebody who's pretty profoundly neurode Divergent myself and when
referring to myself I prefer the term neurode Divergent I don't know maybe it was because I was a punk rocker and that sounds kind of Hardcore or whatever but
as somebody who is very much neurod Divergent themselves I just wanted to say that I know that the whole idea of
Dei has become somehow contentious perhaps in the political sphere nothing I'm saying here today is about the
political sphere I don't want to make this contentious what I really want to leave you with about Dei is this that it
is not about giving some group of people special privileges it's not about shifting privilege
around it's about creating an environment where we can all take our
masks off and be our authentic selves at work and the value that that is going to
unlock is tremendous we know that there's certain forms of ADHD that just
turn out great surgeons we know that there's certain kinds of autism that enable people to become incredibly
detail oriented those folks become great software control testers if you heard Admiral mcraven
talk about being a leader being a a significant part of being a leader is leveraging and maximizing the value of
the talent that you have and when we allow everyone to take those masks off and just be who they are we unlock that
for everyone it is liberating and freeing for
everyone Story number two the businesses will get better at overcoming their
worst traits as I was just saying about neurodiversity we're not going to focus on turning out Cy cookie cutter you know
employees anymore with blue suits and red ties we're going to overcome those traits and generative AI is going to
help us do that prediction number
Monthly electronic electricity rationing
four by 20126 half of G2 members will experience
monthly electronic electricity rationing turning energy or wear operations into
either a competitive advantage or a major failure
risk when I first heard the word rationing in this predict my brain kind
of exploded I mean when I think about rationing right I'm thinking like World War II you can only have so much sugar
you can only bake one cake a month like that's what I think when I think rationing but I live in
Texas where we had a heat bubble over the state for three months and rolling
blackouts I have friends that live in Europe who have experienced electricity
disruption as a result of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine this is real this is real and the real opportunity
here is that we begin to think about as Leaders
the energy consumption inside of our organization as another resource why are
Walmart and Target among the largest owners of solar panels in the world
because when electricity generation cost becomes something that you actually measure on the balance sheet optimizing
that is a way to make money to improve profitability to improve the bottom
line and I want to say that generative AI is not going to be
free the amount of energy that it took to train chat GTP is just about a
gigawatt which is about the amount of electricity that a thousand us households use in a day the amount of
energy that Research indicates they don't publish this information but research researchers into this have have
discovered or believe that chat GTP alone consumes
33,000 households of electricity a
day this is not going to be free it is not going to be
free but we're talking about a value change here and a values change here and
I think that's something that's really important because when I think about the opportunity that generative AI presents
to us particularly in this realm is the ability to really change the value
equation we' have got to stop believing in the idea or the fallacy of unlimited
growth on a planet of finite resources that's not being political that's
nonsensical the opportunity is in your hands because you are going to be the major consumers of electricity inside
your organization you're going going to be some of the people who have to manage that risk for your
Enterprise and I've never seen an obstacle that I can't manage to turn
into an opportunity so when we think about that is also an opportunity to win against competitors who haven't invested
who don't have the same ethos who haven't thought about these problems now I'm GNA ask you another
question if you had a genie and a
lamp I can make one wish what would that be
for I'm not expecting you all to yell it out in unison but if I had to guess if I
could guess what I think you all are wishing for it would be an end to technical debt
End to technical debt
right just get rid of it an end to technical debt oh my God especially in
in in in in in civilizations in in in societies that digitize early right I
talked to many of you you feel like you're suffocating under the weight of the technical debt you're buried under
it now generative AI is not gonna make the technical debt problem go
away but it's going to act as a Rosetta Stone it's going to become a translator
it's going to give us the ability to extract the business logic it's going to give us the ability to extract the
knowledge from these systems
so that we can repurpose them so we can create new capabilities it's going to
help us increase and and modernize our applications
faster it's going to recruit it's going to reduce the replacement cost of these Technologies and if we do it really well
it will do as a colleague of mine said in Australia just a few weeks ago it'll prevent us from creating the next
generation of Legacy systems it'll free us from that
trap generative AI can become the Rosetta Stone I remember when I was CTO
of a bank we are we were replacing our mortgage origination system the three developers who managed our previous
mortgage origination system which was written in some ancient language called primac which I don't even know what that
is they all quit as soon as they knew that we were going to do this and they came back the next day is contractors
doubling their salaries that's a real threat
that's a real thing that happens and with generative AI we're going to have the ability to extract that business
knowledge we're going to have the ability to extract that information and make it far more
portable it may also help us avoid vendor lock
in what I want us to think about here again is is is is that generative
AI used in the right way is going to help us create create better
understanding but just as I said back with the predicts right it's not going to become the output right it's not
going to recode all of this for us because we are still Bound by one very basic phenomena of
computing garbage in garbage out it's not going to be the answers
that chat GP that that chat GTP or Bard or or or or or or or or co-pilot give us
that are going to become the value what we really need to be focusing on instead is the value of the inputs getting
really good at understanding how to give the right kinds of prompts how to give the right kinds of information to these
systems and extracting all of the value from what we' built
already prediction number six comes to us from Dwight kapich by 2028 there will be more smart robots than Frontline
Robots over Frontline workers
workers in manufacturing retail and Logistics not to replace
people just stood fill labor shortages one of the other phenomena
that happened as a result of Co is people started taking gigs they started working for themselves based on digital
platform enablement and as a consequence there are a lot of jobs that are just not being filled by humans anymore and
can't be filled by humans if you look at at countries like Japan who are on the verge of demographic collapse they are
not making enough new babies their population is inverted the triangle is in
inverted the only solution they're going to have to that particular problem is
robots and I don't think that 2028 is too far out to start imagining that
robots might start outnumbering Us in the workforce I don't know if you've been to a grocery store lately but it's kind of hard to find a checkout clerk
right it's all self checkout now it's robots everywhere whether it's my Roomba cleaning my floors or the new pool robot
I got that's got a camera that scans for you know Plankton or whatever it's not Plankton it's
a you know what I mean these robots are not just going to
be about replacing workers it's going to be about augmenting us helping an aging Workforce it's going to become a major
factor in GDP and that's not just in highly Advanced Supply chains right this
is everywhere across our ecosystem we need to think just like what the the opening keynote said yesterday we need
to start thinking about generative AI as a new user interface whether that interface is at a
terminal that I'm talking to or whether that interface is in a robot that's making my coffee for me it's going to
become a new user interface and with this new user
interface that also begins to speak to the need to begin to build better machine to machine interfaces prediction
number seven comes from my dear friends Mark Resino and Don shyen R who you heard from yet who you heard from
Machine Customer Market
yesterday that through 2026 30% of large companies will have dedicated business unit or sales channels to access fast
growing machine customer markets what's a machine
customer well I don't know I got a printer at
home that'll automatically reorder ink for me is that a machine customer oh kinda kind of it will
reorder the ink for me do I ever L it reordering for me no no no I do not no I do not because it
will always order it about 6 months before I need it it will always order it
from the odm and it will always charge me retail plus Plus+ for the convenience of
automatically doing that that is not what we're talking about when we talk about a full machine customer we are talk you know if this was a full machine
customer it would be out scouring to try and find the best deals for me on Inc it
would understand my usage patterns and know that you know I really only print come event season because I like to
print out my things so that I can read them backstage before I come out here and talk to you all but the rest of the year I don't print anything ever it
would understand those consumption behaviors and that's not just going to be in B2B channels it's not just going
to be in advanced Supply Chains It's going to be in B Toc too we already see those little you
know you could buy this from someplace else kind of ads that pop up in some browser add-ins
I ask you another question does anybody here suffer from like massive gear acquisition syndrome there are no golfers in the
room come on I suffer from massive gear acquisition syndrome I really do it's
for me it's not golf it's synthesizers it's drum machines I have got a drum machine addiction and we are not too far
from the future where I can just sort of send a bot out there and say hey man when you find an LM drum for this price
go ahead and get it if you find one for 20% less than that get
two just don't tell my wife I swear to God anytime she sees a box like this shaped come into the house
she's like that's a drum machine that's a synthesizer and she's probably not wrong
but at least in this future I'll be able to point to the bottom be able to say Hey listen the machine got me the best value I could ever get on this thing
honey she'll still be rolling her eyes at the back of her head but at least we'll know that we got a good deal on it
right we need to get good at starting to understand and we need to start thinking about what a machine to machine customer
model looks like do we know how to Market to machines do we know how to advertise do we know how to advertise
our capabilities do we know what kind of slas or operational level agreements machines are going to want to agree to
with each other do we have answers to those questions no but we need to start building them or
else we're going to miss out on one of the fastest growing channels in the world the human Channel only grows at
about 4% a year the machine channel is going to grow at a factor of that times 10 possibly even
more possibly even more the third part of our story is that
new threats create new responsibilities and new communities prediction number eight comes to us from my brother from
Mal Information
another mother Dave Aaron and myself that Mal information is going to become a multi front Threat by 2028 Enterprise
spend on battling Mal information will surpass 30 billion cannibalizing 10% of markets and cyber security budgets to
combat a multi-front threat what is malformation malformation is
algorithmically groomed and targeted disinformation or even the
truth which is out of context and designed to change mental models what do
we mean by changing mental models that is causing you to make decisions that you would not make if you had the
correct fact Base today Mal information is already a78 billion threat and that's
just peop to people Mal information that's just dealing with activists and and other Mal information and
disinformation that exists out there if you want to know the the ball that I had my eye on it's AI based Mal information
it's it's Mal information that is designed to do prompt spiking that is not prompt injection that is causing
your AI to have a hallucination or causing it to ingest data that causes it to hallucinate
spiking The Prompt and that has the potential to grow to enormous
sums it will also create new opportunities for our sios by 2027 45% of sizo remits will
expand Beyond cyber security due to increasing regulatory pressure and attack surface expansion this comes to
us from my dear friend Andrew walls today you guys have been great at
digitizing you guys have been amazing at creating the digital future and for the past 13 or 14 years I've been in CIO or
CEO research I moved to Scio research about 18 months ago because all of the amazing digital transformation
opportunities that I have talked about from this very stage don't become real if we don't get the cyber right and
today every business process is bounded by cyber it's limited by cyber even the
most manual thing you could do getting an oil change in your car you can't do it if the work order system doesn't
print the work ticket if if they can't collect the credit card on the other end and oh by the way if they can't tell my car which is a network of supercomputers
Rolling On Wheels that it has had an oil change none of that process works if the
Cyber doesn't work in addition we have the SEC which has said recently that
there must be an officer in charge in the Enterprise of cyber
security as a consequence we see the role of the sizo evolving into one into
full holistic broadspectrum digital business defense to include cyber
security to include privacy to include even possibly physical
security prediction number 10 unions of people will form to Combat
Unions
Machines we've seen the writer strike in Hollywood we've seen the actors strike in Hollywood we know that our employees
are feeling the pressure they're feeling uncertain they're feeling concerned about their future and generative Ai and
what that means to them this prediction comes from my teammate nater Heinen Helen pumin and uh and
Helen and really I think what we're seeing here is a reaction to that that
we're experiencing anxiety around layoffs we've seen lying flat we've seen
quiet quitting and yeah sure maybe the tech layoffs you know shook stuff up so we got people back to the office a little bit more often we maybe improved
productivity with a little bit of fear uncertainty and doubt but that's not going to be the
answer that's not going to be the answer I think the answer lays again in
what the opening keynote talked about it it it lays in everyday AI it it lay in
allowing your employees to bring the a to work allowing them to experiment with it allowing them to reap the value that
they get from AI in the terms of time savings and the ability to do better or more interesting
things and in closing here I just wanted to say one thing to you bringing us all
the way back to the beginning I don't think the year that everything changed
is hyperbole in fact I want to double down on that and I wanted to say that I'm imploring you to take the decisions
that you make today and into the future about generative AI very very seriously
because we we are literally the last generation of managers who will get to
make those decisions we are making decisions about buying acquiring and building
decision-making machines and after those decisions are made that will become a one-way
door which will become very very difficult to reverse after we made those
decisions so do we decide that our strategy is simply to continue to allow you know wealth to aggregate or do we
decide to empower employees Empower our cens and Empower our co-workers with
this amazing new technology and if we make the right decision folks the future's
ours thank you
