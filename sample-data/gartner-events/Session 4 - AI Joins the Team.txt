prise scene and not as a passive technology anymore but as a decision
companion AI joins the team good afternoon I'm Eric branu as my
accent does not indicate I live in Chicago where I cover artificial intelligence techniques and decision
intelligence for Gartner two quick things first AI does
not equal generative ai ai is a discipline it's a set of Computer
Engineering techniques like rule based systems machine learning capabilities knowledge graphs optimization techniques
that are make to solve business problems generative AI is a practice of AI which
uses Those computer techniques that I just talked about second AI does not equal robotics
either Ai and Robotics are coming together because robotics is a use case of AI 98% of the robots in the world are
using no AI whatsoever and they are still doing a good job AI is no longer a
prop it's an actor it becomes an integral part of the collaboration
environment in our organizations the inflection point has been sudden for the massive amount of
people that have been exposed to chat GPT that acceleration and that
application was sudden for those that have seen the human tone of voice the
versatility of the technology they realized what the technology could do
and for them it was nothing short of magic illustrating the famous ular quote
every sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic there is another irresistible
Force pushed by Ai and it's the Advent of the movement from data centricity to
decision centricity focused on outcomes I should say a shift in a center of
gravity because data capabilities remain Central and fundamental for AI but AI
just doesn't deliver insights anymore AI also delivers now decision
intelligence we are elevating the plane of perspective it allows us to see further than just the Insight of what's
next what's the next action we should do AI the actor decides to collaborates as
well augments and becomes a team member it's embedded in a fabric of our
organization and AI almost now is no longer an innovation it's a permanent
fixture of our technology landscape and who should get used to that it's propelling the organization in
what we call the AI natives they are born with AI they are the children of the digital
natives most of them today are trying trying to create that overnight proposition but it will take some time
you the large majority of you have already started with AI for Point
projects you heard in a keynote yesterday the omnipresence of AI from
everyday AI making everyone accter to gamechanging AI trying to change also
the nature of our own businesses reaching the investment
escape velocity speed allows us to detach ourselves from the productivity
grain gravity as we move forward to push us forward and Propel us further with
those kind of techniques everyday AI consists essentially of things you're already
doing today productivity capabilities within boundaries business as usual if
slightly augmented gamechanging AI is a different
proposition it's looking at breaking or pushing boundaries doing things we have not done yet this is is where heroes are
made where differentiation lives and where mostly we are changing those business models we talked about and
markets are born our aim today is to pave the way and show a new strategy
around AI initiatives that looks around those boundaries and what kind of applications you can actually start
implementing to be able to push those forward AI might be changing many things in a workplace but one thing that does
not change is the way we invest we are already in the AI game you
all have a cell phone and on that cell phone AI is already integrated whether you want it or not it's already there
most of us Len are with GPS systems because that's where AI plays a role as well we are all on a journey we are all
there to go where no one has gone before even in some applications that we believe could be mundane and the good
news is that we don't have to go to the moon right away we can stay in familiar territory we call it within B boundaries
many organizations are there today most of what we see here in that category belongs to productivity gains but there
is a caution here most organization that Focus exclusively on productivity gains
are running the risk of being passed by by more daring competitors that are pushing those boundaries further and I
mean the full spectrum of AI techniques by the way not just generative AI but beyond that moving through these
boundaries is not a sequential proposition and that's why I referred before as a Nite portfolio of
initiatives with increasingly risky but rewarding initiatives that you can go through
today I would say that about 80% of our clients are in that segment today that's
where most of their initiatives reside on pushing productivity AI is already embedded in
their application and in that case by the way it's better to buy than to make
as much as possible just take advantage of the functionality that already exist
within those application and solutions those project have a Time Horizon of about 12 months usually in
terms of investment you should count in the low 10 of thousands to the low hundred of thousands of dollars and
again not much more development governance is going to start appearing already at that level but productivity
gain does not mean that those application can be mundane or cannot be
in ative or imaginative Tech py of Microsoft
research is specializing in healthcare and life sciences and he's was a skeptic
about the technology originally because he understands the underlying techniques really well so he decided to start new
use cases to help doctors write letters to patients actually he pushed it one
level further and trying to get that technology to write letter for very
sensitive case parents of a sick child what he wanted from the technology in
the prompt he said I want something that's direct factual to inform the
parents but also taking into consideration the very sensitive situation the parents are in I want
empathy I want something that be able to reassure the parents as well at the same
time me you examples of that letters during our meeting I observed some
troubling signs including low blood pressure irregular hot Rhythm and Donnie hair on
her back and arms I believe Meg is very ill and we need to work together to help
her get well factual direct and yet inclusive
with some empathy building as well together we need to work with Meg to support her to surround her let her down
in the letter while there is certainly work to be done I am optimistic that
with the right support and treatment plan Meg can make a full recovery and Achieve Optimal Health hopeful empathic
again and inclusive the letter was remarkable actually astonishing it shook petly
skepticism in the technology it shows also that you can bring empathy in Spock like
doctors most of what we see Happening Here is the fact that with the prompt
it's also showing a shift what's becoming important in generative in particular is not as much the answer as
the way you ask the questions and I will come back to that in a moment as we know gen just write letters
they also write code and actually code generation and translation is becoming
one of the top use cases worldwide regardless of the industry or regardless
of the different sections of where the code is implemented now of course many
implementors also have verification and validation procedures as they've seen nonsensical code also and sometimes
malicious code sneaking in nonetheless that remains one of the places where
productivity is really seriously augmented but AI is much more broadly
applicable in my and I'm almost to say that 35 years of careers losing AI
techniques I've seen all kind of use cases 10 of thousands in the last 30
years I've seen things in fraud detection churn reduction maintenance
predictive maintenance I've seen things around product equality inspections many many many use cases using all aspect of
within boundaries AI techniques next come where we question
those boundaries where we push them a little further and in that case we move from exploration symbiosis and we push
those boundaries further with an explicit permission to explore come an explicit permission to fail as long as
we learn from those failures of course there will be no Apollo 11 without an
Apollo one as we move forward we see 17% of your initiative that should be in that
segment they're looking at a deadline of about 18 months and they're looking at
potentially challenging use cases with a growth or smart reduction in mind
technology should help us abandon some bad habits as well not just augmenting them and flashing us beeping us
vibrating us all the time on a regular basis we are crossing industry domains and business functions here and we are
focused on Innovation much more development here AI engineering is
becoming a key discipline also within that section and in that case you are
looking at a low 100 of thousands to the low millions of dollars pushing boundaries can bring unexpected results
and benefits far. a a company we will hear from in a minute has actually done this
they applied that technology in the game of go and what they have shown is
something extraordinary go Masters have been playing that game for Millennia and yet the system has been
able to show them a new way to win the game let's hear it from Adam GLE the CEO
of far AI The Story begins in 2016 with deep mind's Alpha go becoming the first AI
system to beat professional go player experts were amazed that alphao had uncovered strategies but had evaded
thousands of years of human study since then Goa systems have grown even stronger with a modern AI system katago
able to beat alphago 100,000 games to one a leading go player Lisa doll commented that AI systems are an entity
that cannot be defeated in 2022 far AI developed an adversarial strategy that
learned to consistently beat Caso amazing L this strategy is simple enough that it can be executed by a human
without the aid of a computer one of our team members Kellen pin is even able to
consistently beat kago after giving the AI system a very substantial handicap to
our surprise although the attack was only ever designed to exploit catago the
same strategy is able to beat a wide range of other AI systems including Clos Source systems we had no prior access to
these results underscore that although machine Learning Systems can often achieve impressive and even sometimes
superhuman average case performance the techniques used to train them provide no guarantees as to the worst case
performance of these systems even highly capable AI systems may have Achilles heels that cause them to suddenly fail
catastrophically and without warning fell catastrophically and without
warning hey I start those go Masters things they thought were best practices
for multiple centuries and yet the system was able to solve the puzzle in a new way to the point now actually where
go Masters learn that new methodology that was also put as an alternative by
those systems AI has Tau Humanity something which is not nothing but AI
system again despite their generalization capability do not fail gracefully the improve they improve on
average or best cases but they have a very hard time to close the gap when it comes to worst cases this highlight the
importance of human beings and developers checking those systems and
verifying those systems regularly that's the symbiosis we've been talking about
pushing boundaries can have other unexpected consequences too in the case
that Adam was talking about few go Masters stopped playing the game
altogether the impact of those Technologies on people should never be
underestimated no matter how cool we we think they are finally to venture into the real of
magic we're looking at the breaking boundaries category when new form of cooporation emerge where AI could
acquire some form of agency it is the remaining 3% of that portfolio of
initiatives I was talking about the time Horizon of those project is about 24
months radical new plays daring use cases that have potential to alter
industry create new business functions that's the upper right end quadrant of the opportunity radar that you saw
yesterday into the keynote creative imaginative redefining actual business
and operational models now these projects are expensive they are in low
Millions to the m tens of millions of dollars they need to be vetted carefully
before venturing into these new territories eneda
biosciences a biotechnology company whose mission is to transform human
health by maping and discovering Nature's chemistry has done this they
have leveraged generative Ai and it's almost weird to say that traditional machine learning techniques to discover
new drugs let's hear it from Tom Adena natural products are chemical
compounds that are produced by natural sources like plants and fungi they are the source of over a third of Humanity's
medicinal portfolio including medicines that address critical Global Health needs including malaria heart disease
and cancer in spite of their incredible clinical success less than 1% of natural
products are known to science the remaining 99% is a potential Treasure
Trove of new medicines ineda is building Technologies to unlock this cache our
machine learning models analyze interpret and translate data from
biological samples concurrently giving us information about the underlying
chemical structures of the natural products their drug likeness and bioavailability in mere moments this
information could potentially take years to obtain using classical methods our models combine generative AI methods
which allow us to predict the structure of natural products that have never been seen before by science with classical
machine learning approaches to estimate the reliability of the structure predictions this power combination
enables our drug Hunters to make informed prioritization decisions speeding the drug Discovery process and
helping us to deliver new medications to patients faster our entire pharmacopia relies on
less than 1% of natural products I don't know about you but I was totally flawed
when Tom told me about that surprisingly what he said it works because it seems
that there's a strong parallel between natural language con stres like grammar
and chemistry vocabulary which allows them to unlock the 99% and significantly
address and accelerate the drug Discovery process so discovering new drug at that rate is already amazing but
will they work in humans what about clinical trials well another remarkable thing
that NVA has done is that they have gathered ancestral medical knowledge or
ethnobotany to be that it's actually traditional medicine that has been gathered by centuries Traditions to be
able to understand also what have worked in humans now they're combining that drug Discovery with strong foundations
for clinical trials how is that for breaking boundaries composite AI is what eneda is
using here they are you discovering the unknown using machine learning
techniques hidden correlations in the data and they are using graph and r
rule-based systems to capture existing known knowledge precious known knowledge
that knowledge that resides in the head of your best employees that capture is possible those
techniques are decades old ethnobotany is what my grandmother was
doing without knowing it she had these jars of leaves in her cupboards and she
used to mix those leaves to treat all kind of ailments
she got that from her mother that got it from her mother who got it from her mother and so on and today I'm sitting
here I'm sitting here I'm wondering what have I retain of that incredible precious
knowledge that is what my wisdom has been reduced to a preman nepresso herbal
tea capsule soured by a little of my shame but once you broke boundaries what
lies Beyond is it possible possible to start redefining the game itself can
machine become self sustaining investors and decide by themselves how to
structure powerful portfolios AI as an actor also means
machine as clients it means the ability to generate synthetic agencies of rational agent
running businesses on their own it means adaptive system unleashing the learning
techniques to look at enforcing circumstances and adjust to them using
adaptive AI it means creating new data to better anticipate Complex events and
you think I'm dreaming a few are already among us today Capital Logics is doing just that
they have an investment systems which can learn organize and reconfigure
itself for best performance it can even change in own learning mechanism by deciding how to
invest as with every AI model the challenge is to temper those models over
confidence or teaching AI some humility generative AI is now moving
into the next phase already it's generating actually and spawning swarms of agents that can act
by themselves autonomous agents now imagine we have employees digital twins
that generate different rational agents to perform various functions that we do on a daily basis and those are there to
engage and respond to our friends our colleagues our managers our business
partners and as we do that then we thinking well if we can make that happen then what about adding a new personal
digital twin for home that interacts with our family with our kids with our friends with our Star Trek fan club all
these different things also well once we've done this who has priority who decides how do you
orchestrate those what if your colleagues friends and family and everybody else start
making these agents possible how do we form preferences how do they
evolve all of those twin agents start acting on our behalf personally and
professionally on behalf of others humans or machines on behalf of organizations
their complex interaction will give way to what we call emergent properties now let's not take that for
senss okay let's not get there but instead our upcoming challenge which is
already among us today is due to guide and orchestrate those emerging rational agents
into who knows maybe a new form of intelligence thinking decisioning
companions who have to teach some AI some Humanity as well at some
point but let's come back to today the challenge of becoming an AI native again
within boundaries and pushing boundaries and breaking boundaries and the further you go the bigger the impact but also
the bigger the risk and of course when you start looking at those systems we might have to mitigate to keep AI Fair
reliable and sustainable and we know how much those very large language models
are consuming in terms of energy obviously the portfolio profile will also vary across organizations you
do not have all the same appetite for risk considering the new rate of change and the learning curve organization
within their portfolio within boundaries have to make sure that if they stay within boundaries they will compromise
their chances to compete your existing use cases are
already an indication they should help you you've learned a lot to that process already the
portfolio approach hopefully should help you properly forward with mitigating that risk but fast following is no
longer an option unless you're a greyhound dog walker you need to establish the Rules
of Engagement you need to rely on imagination and audacity and move Beyond productivity but be aware there's a trap
between within boundaries and pushing boundaries many organization that are focusing on
productivity gains are focusing exclusively on Personnel reductions which then limit their
success in the latter 20% of the portfolio when it become impossible sometimes to reacquire that
Talent we see that AI is Shifting the value proposition from full-time employee reduction to augmenting the
value of your existing employees and I've seen that in the nine
in the last nine month many many time over nothing new here by the way AI
engineer and gener in particular is just accelerating the
timeline in our writing code example that new code will still have to be
embedded into business processes verified validated and who's going to do
that software engineers and then we're going to have to ask the right questions to those
systems who is going to do that prompt Engineers have heard of prompt Engineers I bet you have but a year ago at the
same time not so sure so those new skills are emerging within AI today and we need to
make sure that we push them forward because beyond the boundaries the risk is at its highest but regardless of the
level of initiatives again failure should be an option because the risk of
doing nothing has never been higher people move fast
my esteem colleague Kevin gabard who worked with juston ma it's a global
Specialty Company and chemicals and sustainable Technologies has witnessed this firsthand they looked at the
critical element of innovation thinking let's hear it from Kevin we spoke to Johnson maty a
sustainable Technologies company about their process for Innovation one executive who facilitates their
brainstorming sessions noted that he really has to push their very oper ation focused Business Leaders to open up to
weird even obscure ideas after brainstorming they assess their 10% most futuristic and aspirational ideas were
three things the alignment to their Enterprise strategy how much competitors are investing or expressing interest and
whether ideas are even technically feasible they noted three kinds of opportunities first necessary bets which
have clear implications for the competitive landscape that is everyone else is investing and so there's a clear
road map next seemingly impossible wins which represent latent value because
they are presumed to be highly aspirational when in fact they're feasible with available technology these
Investments might not have attracted attention from competitors and so provide high impact even if they are
nich finally stretch aspirations are cuttingedge opportunities to reshape the
business strategy the market or the industry by investing in nent Trends and embracing
uncertainty so if we're going to achieve the promise of the coming wave of AI
technology we must challenge ourselves to have really big imaginations and we must be bold it's GLI to say that we
don't act because we fear failure that's been done we've made failure safe enough
to take our organizations across the boundaries of what is currently possible we must be prepared to take
unconventional even daring next steps daring next steps so 10% of the
most futuristic and inspirational ideas are made of these three things alignment
to Enterprise strategy pretty obvious although very hard to achieve in many cases interest and investment from
competitors and that's why it shows also that Niche capabilities sometimes that have worth exploring despite their
perceived negative return but the doubt on technology feasibility that's the
Treasure Trove this is where AI can make a big difference because today many
things we think are impossible are really coming in a real mod of possibility without a tremendous amount
of investment from a number of initiatives perspective your portfolio includes many
initiatives within boundaries essentially focus on productivity gain but when you look at the impact it's a
mirror view of that it's where most of those opportunities come when you start
breaking boundaries and that's where differentiation needs and breakthroughs are made clearly the lesson here is that
the challenge with pushing head with a eye would be a lack of imagination not a lack of AI magic breaking
boundaries might be your safest way to compete like Kevin said ween faing
pretty safe and there are undeniable risks that are linked to the ey portfolio and the idea is to
realistically face those risk and start establishing an effective learning culture knowing that the learning curve
is becoming incompressible we are suggesting that as Talent keeps narrowing you need to name
an AI lead a lead AI orchestrator someone that will work with all the
executive within your organization to orchestrate those AI initiatives that person will also start
looking into exploring innovative business ideas and finally start to
initiate an AI literacy program AI does not signal the obsolesence of natural
intelligence it is a possibility and emergence of augmented intelligence that's what AI should stand for augment
M mented intelligence in other words the opportunity to invent a symbiotic
relationship I'm confident that you already started you already are on that Journey one way or the other you already
started those processes inside your organization initiate your own AI portfolio open your AI Labs do not wait
or you will not be able to catch up learning time is incompressible then expand and balance that AI portfolio do
not focus exclusive on everyday Ai and within boundaries you might not
be able to catch up to achieve gamechanging AI be audacious break those boundaries look beyond that it's 3% it's
expensive but it's 3% and finally orchestrate your AI
portfolio go beyond prototyping start scanning AI look at the responsible
manner you should be doing that as well name your a to coordinate the efforts across your organization that person
could be you we are only at the beginning of this journey as we have finally created a
sparring partner for our intelligence are we at the dawn of Danny
hilly wish I want to make a machine that can be proud of
us thank you
