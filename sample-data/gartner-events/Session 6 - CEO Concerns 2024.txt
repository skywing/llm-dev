the data that we're going to show you this morning is from our midyear update
and so there's about 109 respondents now we just put our next survey our the the
big F year results usually come in may we just put that survey out in the field
but we've seen a really big strategic shift in the data this
year and what it's showing is that CEOs sense a new economic future that's
emerging and it's an AI economic future we've only seen this big of a
strategic shift one other time and that was in 2012 coming out of the global financial crisis and so now another big
post crisis strategy is emerging and what we're going to do this morning is we're going to show you how to be in the
very center of this AI economic future so so let's begin the Topline
results from our survey are always what are the top business priorities that you're looking at Mark great start thank
Top Business Priorities
you okay let's take a look at the data that we've got on our standard first question that we've been asking for
years and years and years which is what are your top five strategic business priorities in your own words we always
ask them for their priorities in their own words so we do not give a list to buas but we've evolved from that data
over 12 14 years now a categorization structure which we we believe really
represents the true mind of the chief executive not the kind of structure that you might want to impose on the way they
think or anyone else might right so the top of the list we as usual we see growth but growth here has kind of
increased a little so actually in some senses the confidence in being able to grow companies has been rising slightly
and we were on this stage last year we were talking about the possibility of recession we kind of thought that was
overdone now people are talking about soft Landing I think the confidence has actually gone up a little goes up and
down month by month but things overall on an annualized basis are looking quite good technology related is our second
category that's the second most important category everything will go in there like CRM or e-commerce digital
business all kinds of truly Tech related categories that has been towards the top
for some years now and is showing a significant pop that is to do with AI
and we'll come on to do with that later Workforce is still up there as a really
significant issue look you know despite perhaps weaker economics we still have
talent shortfalls we still have relatively close to full employment in lots of the countries in which your
larger corporations are doing business we've got um a diminution here in the
corporate category now people ask us what does that mean it's it's kind of corporate action that is working on the
corporation that's things like merges and Acquisitions creating a new strategy consolidating the structure of the firm
those kinds of things and you can see that's dipped a bit and that's because CEOs are kind of holding back slightly
until they really start to launch their bigger changes and moves we think next
year into 2024 now cost management is not that high high right and that tells
us that they're reasonably confident if there was a significant chance of recession coming Christian right that we
know that number would be higher right then we've got customer you know customers kind of lulling around the
middle bit there they're not worried about getting customers we're not in a
downturn you know we got sufficient demand we're still working through supply chain problems actually so
matching supply and demand is often more a concern about the supply still than it is about the demand no real change on
the emphasis on products and services the financial category where you'd get things like difficulties with borrowing
uh and getting hold of capital or issues with cash flow those kinds of things again that's down there towards the
bottom showing some really effective stability we've got environmental
sustainability right which is a significant category Kristen which is you know it is yeah so it's holding
steady last year it was up quite a bit we think because of concern over energy Security in Europe it's not as big of a
concern so it's about to where it was prior to that yeah but it's been holding in the top 10 for a while now so we know it's a true strategic persistent issue
rather than just something that comes and goes and then you know the continuing surprise to all of us um what
can we say efficiency and productivity is not not coming to mind I mean at
least it's in the top 10 but for those of you who think that you know it's automatic that corporations want to
really work hard on efficiency and productivity that's not Remains Not Top
of mind for CEOs yet but we think the investment cycle
could be turning now if you look at what's happened over the last couple of years with CEO investment Intentions by
different categories you can see that there's been a little bit of a downward Trend we're expecting that to rebound as
we get our next set of survey results in because of this you know kind of C ious sense of stability another thing to
notice about this chart is look at look back to 2012 and it's been just a general increase in Investments since
that time we really haven't had a major recession uh you know through this
period of time now one thing I want to call your attention to take a look at that third bar from the bottom I think
it's light green I'm colorblind so I'm not exactly sure but it's it's basically the risk bar
and um last year when Mark and I were on stage we held up a big letter r for
recession and the letter R is still here it's just that this year it's for risk
look at what's happened uh with a percentage of CEOs that are mentioning the word risk when they talk about their
top priorities and look at the last time risk was this High look it was in the
2012 2013 time time frame now some of what's in this bar are things like
macroeconomic concern geopolitics cyber security but really the reason for the
big pop this year the big upward trend is that CEOs know they need to make
their big moves and they need to make them now there's $2.6 trillion dollar of dry powder
that's sitting on the sidelines and CEOs know that kind of this you know
uncertainty in action excuse of the last few years um investors just won't
tolerate that anymore and so they're getting ready to make their big moves now yeah those activists they're waiting
so those activist investors they're waiting with that money they want to plon it down back end of this year early into next year and so executive teams
that haven't got anything haven't got a really good strategic plan they're not enacting new uh ideas they they are at
risk now of that of that kind of action and so they're needing to make those investment moves and that's why we had
risk on up on the screen there but but what are they going to do how does that
parameterized because we've got a different environment now we've got inflation we've got a different cost of
capital right and and so uh what we've what we've seen here is that CEOs are
looking for investment ideas in their business initiatives some of which will
be your Concepts your technology related ideas and your projects where they want
a higher rate of return on those projects you know that hurdle rate that your CFO is setting is likely to be
easing upwards so the projects you're competing with for tech for tech ideas
that will come up but in order to kind of control for that risk they are prepared for that for that to come back
over a little longer so the time frame of return the idea that we have to have the results quickly and it's all about
quick and dirties that will ease out because one of the ways to deris risk is
to just take a little bit longer over those kinds of projects so this we're expecting to see these numbers shift on
our next update this is something we're watching very carefully now given what we've said so
far and with the remainder of the data we're going to show you we're going to give you this year two action areas to
really think about we want you to think about finding the foundations for the mid to long-term
strategy of a postcrisis future know uh Kristen just mentioned about the
2012 13 time frame that was after the financial crisis when companies needed
to come back and find their new long range strategy when things settled down again we're at that turning point so
we're going to be looking for the what are the foundations of your corporation's strategic look moving
forward and then how are you going to frame AI into that because CEOs are very
interested and their boards are very interested as we'll come on to show and so you've got a frame an AI future into
that set of possibilities for your longer range strategy so let's look first at finding
these foundations of your post crisis strategy most CEOs have already started
the work of doing this so we're on this Turning Point we've got 20% or so who said we've already got our long-term
post poly crisis strategy and by the crisis here we really mean things like obviously the pandemic which conditioned
us all things like the Ukrainian uh situation possibly I guess the effects
of the awful things happening also in the Middle East but and as we lead out of a lot of that we're looking for that
new future nearly half are working on their long range strategy now and only
10% are postponing it off to next year so that means as we go from 23 into 24 we're going to be starting to move into
the action of the next long range strategy and responsible profitability
Responsible Profitability
is what investors are really asking for from CEOs right now so uh you know
number one biggest shift in investor expectations better profit return look
at Revenue it's fallen off this this top you know five or six list and the reason
for that is that you know CEOs have been able to grow their organizations on cheap credit for the last 20 years
credit isn't cheap what investors really want is value now and that's
profitability but it's not just profitability at any cost it's responsible profitability taking into
account for example environmental and social change um you know better use of
capital uh improving business resilience so the name of the game this year
responsible profitability but it's going to be a challenge because inflation is proving
Inflation
to be scky I mean you know we've gotten it down to 3.7% at this point but that's still well
above the fed target rate and so 53% of CEO saying they're expecting inflation
to be kind of persistent low growth a little bit stagflationary
sounding think about the last time that you did an Erp or core application
implementation the first half of that problem you know our implementation was
easier than the second half and so why would we think that it would be any different for Central Bankers absolutely
Central Bank is trying to fix inflation the hard bits yet to come you're absolutely right and I've heard I've been reading a little bit that the a
suggestion that the US inflation rate might just move up a little bit that certainly it's not just going down in
tidy something it's popping back up again you may have noticed those of you don't know me that my accent is British
I'm over from London and um so we've got the Union Jack up there the um this company here and this chief executive
rashen Curry she's she's managing a company called Greggs if you were British you would know who Greggs were everyone does it's a bit like a Panera
Bread that kind of a chain everyone goes there for lunch um except there's a lot more pastry involved and we get fatter
um so here but look at the quote that she's giving here this is the reality for a lot of CEOs around the world right
now I don't currently see deflation in the market I wish I was I'm not seeing it yet you know I've got I've got wage
pressure issues on minimum wage people people serving you know pastry overc counts I've got energy inflation because
I've got those Baker I got those baking ovens out the back and I've got lots of concerns about the cost of energy coming
from natural gas prices coming from electricity prices and then I've got commodity inflation and that's going to be in things as you know just like flour
right coming from grain because the Bread Basket of Europe which is in Ukraine is being damaged and these kinds
of factors are still weighing very heavily on what CEOs are having to
do but it's not just that they're dealing with all kinds of other issues in Talent apart from just the wage
pressure they they're still dealing with the hybrid stuff you know and they're still dealing with all kinds of uh Dei
related factors and so they have big challenges around T talent and they're not going to go away some of them
actually wanted in a sense almost wanted a recession in order to ease up on the
on the supply of labor right and allow for you know a bit of pressure down on
wages but but that isn't happening so this is not the talent issue is not a transient thing that you can just wait
out and hope that the economic cycle will fix it for you the talent challenges are deep and structural and
persistent um and you know we can see this in the data again looking for this key word when we look at the word talent
how often does the word talent actually arise when CEOs are talking about their
top priorities you can see it's as high as we've ever seen seen it on this chart right um and so you know big part of the
strategies are going to be framed around what do we do about employment what do we do about Talent context related to
inflation but all of the other complications of running a business and if we turn to ESG and
sustainability the CEO of Coca-Cola here saying you know if ESG becomes a toxic
phrase then he'll stop using the term ESG but many of the environmental social
social and governance issues are important for him to keep growing his business so you know water uh packaging
healthy drinks all part of the business growth strategy and in fact when we look
at the data overall what CEOs are saying is that sustainability is part of their
growth strategy so 64% of CEOs agreeing environmental sustainability is a growth
strategy and some sometimes this is about Market access and gaining more Market access if you're meeting customer
needs in this area sometimes it's brand new products and services but a key part
of the the growth strategy going forward yeah I mean and here's an example of an American company where you know this is
a key part of the growth strategy and you might think well okay let's take a company like Air Products which is dealing with industrial gases right you
think okay well they've got big plant they've got to control their energy use so they've got the need to apply with
some of the environmental concerns right but where's the growth strategy the growth strategy for example would be
look there's an energy transition take going on there's going to be a hydrogen economy right so this is a g gases
company the hydrogen economy they're going to be part of that there are going to be machines as they already are in
some parts of the world already started that literally suck carbon dioxide out of the air and then we want to do
something with that now you can just get rid of the CO2 but often the CO2 is a useful gas in some context so in nearly
every case when you look hard enough at an industry there are opportunities for growth for new product for Innovation
and for revenue from the green economy right so one of the other challenges
that they're really dealing with on that context though is this reglobalization so it's okay to say you know this is an
American company doing what it does to do in America but of course it's going to have international operations and
it's going to have to worry about the supply chain Maybe some of the metals that are going into the containers that
are containing the gases where do those come from where does that steel come from you know what countries do we get
it from our what's our geopolitical attitude towards those countries we know
that this is getting really difficult we know that the relationship this country and therefore you know the West if you
like towards China is causing real difficulties so that result really surprised me you know you got 78% of
respondents saying that they are reducing their dependency on the Chinese market given how for the last 25 years
we've made the world depend on each other and the price of things coming
from China has been a key part of the way our economies work this is a really big shift and these things are going to
continue to impact Supply chains for quite a long time to come that's another one of those persistent challenges
right so we know that against all of that backdrop digital remains important
so Chief Executives have not stopped using the dword sorry wish they had it's we know
it's meaningless and yet digital you know going to have to live with it this is the frequency of use of the word
digital when describing their top business priorities you see that dip last year we thought it was going down
at last but no it's going up again so you're going to have to continue to contend with that digital will be
a key part of the major strategy change that they're going to bring to bear from 24 onwards we've only got 4% who saying
they're not really doing anything with digital we've got 25% still who saying they're just
starting now it's 2023 a quarter come on right um we've
got another quarter saying they're less than half done right yeah and then a quarter that are saying they're a little
more than half done 1% saying we're done
but my my favorite one on here is the 133% that are saying continuous and and
unending and I used to be a runner Mark I know you're a runner I had a poster on
my wall at one time that was a picture of a runner that said there is no Finish Line and so I mean with digital really
there is no Finish Line uh just like with digital and running I'm sorry to tell you mark yeah only just just only
just got up to 10K so the idea that it's endless is not really something I'm looking forward to to be honest with you
yeah yeah yeah all right so Tech is going to be key to to
whatever your organization's post crisis strategy looks like from a talent
perspective it's really about humancentric productivity so productivity that gets dull dirty
dangerous work um out of the way from profit it's everyday AI like we saw
yesterday in the keynote things that are driving efficiency especially inside the
organization with sustainability there's ecosystem data platforms that are emerging where competitors in an
industry are agreeing on set ways of collecting data from supply chain partners and then with reglobalization
it's not just the digital supply chain it is that but it's also the autonomous
self-healing supply chain so some actions that you can take right
now discover what the timing of your CEO's long-term business strategy is
most likely it's happening now and so assert your personal input right in that
whenever there are big strategy resets like this you know how it is I mean there's you know noisy internal players
and and Consultants your voice is really critical because of your expertise at
this you know incredible intersection that we're seeing of technology and and Ai and
business establish how the competition is going to change in your industry you know your
government organization or uh you know Corporation they may not be the ones to
you know disrupt the industry based on this AI economic future but if you know
what it's going to look like you can create kind of a a protective moat around your organization now
and then offer up potential longer returns as Mark was showing CEOs are
ready to you know take a little bit more risk with a little bit longer of a payback
AI
time okay so what we've said to you is basically you need to get right under it
what is the business strategy going to be right because this is the turning
point in that big strategy cycle now once you know that once you've done your
internal intelligence work some of that might be intuition and guess work as well as absolute fact right where you
think things are headed next then you're going to map the technology onto it and a huge part of that right now is going
to be the AI future because you're going to have to bet big and fast on that why
an AI future specifically right why that specifically I mean we've had people
talk about how important the metaverse was or how important blockchain was recently so why are we saying that it's
not just because it's the new thing that the tech sectors got excited about is because your chief executive and your
board of directors are definitely definitely thinking hard about it and much more engaged in many ways certainly
than they were with some of those in the past so we've asked very recently in recent years we've been asking this question what technology do you think or
will most significantly impact your industry over the next three years and the answers to this open question all
over the place right they've got they ask they talk about electrification ation they talk about new materials and
graphine and all kinds of stuff stuff in chemistry it's not just digital and information technology but when we
categorize that naturally arising data we've seen that AI has been the top category for the last several years but
as you can see back in 2021 the top category was only taking 15 one 15% of responses now we're over half
of Chief executives are overwhelmingly saying AI is going to be
the thing right and that is a huge finding this is the CEO of NAB a bank in
Australia and what he's saying here is you know either we need to get in front of this trend or someone else is going
to get in front of it for us interestingly he flew his executive team
from Australia to the us to meet with some of the hyperscalers and Consulting
companies kind of reminiscent of the you know kind of the digital startup tours that that we used to to see more you
know about 10 years ago and um I was just at it Symposium uh in Gold Coast in
Australia it is a long flight to go from Australia to the us so that was quite a commitment yeah so you can imagine like
he's dragging his entire exective team out over those flights and not all happy about that right it's got to be done
okay but does your CEO really appreciate what AI is capable
of no you know but but I think if we're all intellectually humble here together
I mean none of us really are we're all trying to get our arms around this I would say that your CEO understands AI
better than the metaverse better than blockchain uh but so on the one hand no
they don't but on the other hand they do because they're using it yeah so 44% of
AI in jobs
CEOs are using AI in their jobs 75% have
used it 44% % have used it in the in their jobs and the way that they're
using it is largely in their communication you know kind of writing
some communication using chat gbt to make it sound better dress it up a little bit um they're using it in
research look at the bottom one on this list job
descriptions there has always been a path for cios to go to the CEO role a
makes this a much more likely a much wider Road a much more likely path to go
from CIO to CEO and so maybe your CEO is using chat GPT to write your next job
description yeah I mean there's a good example here this to pick this quote specifically because this guy is
European head of a company that's in publishing right so it's a company that you know whose product is the written
word and and so he's reading all the time and he said what I asked chat GPT about the impact of chat GPT and
generative I AI on my own industry as publishing it prepared a phenomenal text
you know I mean it's pretty impressive stuff and let me tell you I remember when we did Kristen we did the question
uh have you used an iPad in your job right that's decade ago whenever it was the first you know the first six months
and I think about you know it's about 40 something percent of CEOs said yeah I'm using an iPad in my job within the first
six months I've never seen anything like that since and here we've got like half of them actually doing this using this
thing directly it's quite quite incredible some of them can even
contemplate the idea as they're starting to really get their minds forward of using well we use the nice word
synthetic video but you know what we mean deep fake right they they would even consider using a deep fake of
themselves it's beginning to Dawn on them that that's how far this
counterfeit reality kind of thing would go you know in order perhaps to you know extend themselves to be able to
communicate more places and times to use like an avatar version of themselves and
I know that you doubt me don't you when I say that right and there these few weirdos on this chart right who've done
that ah careful who you call weirdo right look at this quote read the
quote the chief executive of the place you're sitting right now almost a light-hearted remark but
you know it's all on the edge there right CEOs have also discussed
AI in boards
generative AI with their Boards of directors and here we mean you know not the management committee the you know the supervisory board of directors we've
got uh we've got information here that shows just how frequent those conversations have been so the vast
majority of boards have discussed generative AI specifically at least once
this year some of them have discussed it more than once and some of them had hold dedicated meetings the board of
directors about this subject yeah luckily Mark for us they're
Growth opportunity
thinking of it as a growth opportunity so 74% of CEOs saying that you know um um
the use of chap GPT and AI in general is a growth opportunity for their company
looking on the bottom of the list very few are thinking of it in terms of significant headcount reduction
opportunity at least right now I think what happened here is that CEOs watched
high-tech company after high-tech company come out with announcements about how they were going to grow their
organizations using generative Ai and I think CEOs could kind of picture
themselves in that story yeah to an extent CEOs aren't worried about the
Role for CIOs
singularity they you know 78% say that generative AI is much more of an
opportunity the benefits outweigh the risks do you believe them because much of this is going to
fall on you to help balance out and in fact one of the roles for you to play
right now is to help your CEO cut through the hype with AI and I think
that's what the CEO of Walmart here is really saying you know we need to stay focused on what we're trying to solve
for there's kind of this new shiny thing you know on the side of the road and you
know with strategy it's very important that you keep moving forward on what that long-term strategy is not get too
diverted by the shiny thing on the side of the road and so help your CEO make
sure that the organization is using AI for the right things that is you know
that's great wisdom from him and he's spent the last decade competing with Amazon right and Walmart I don't know if
you saw this just last week I think it was in The Fortune Magazine global 500 remains at the very top it's beating out
you know Saudi aramco and and CN and all of those right okay let's look at the actions you need to take here identify
like the top three business capabilities needed for your new strategy so what
what are the competencies what are the capabilities that are going to be needed in your corporation to enact that mid to
long-term strategy that you've been identifying from our first argument right brainstorm how AI specifically
could make the biggest difference to some of those key capabilities and competencies this is isn't about
spraying AI all over the landscape you know it's about finding those critical swing competencies are going to make the
biggest difference to your strategy brainstorm how AI will play there right
try as best as you can at this juncture to call out and kill AI
washing we saw 10 years ago what happened as digital which was a regionally cogent argument about digital
business change at the beginning say 2012 13 by the the end of the decade the word digital was meaningless because
people had just wallpapered it everywhere and called Everything digital do not let your colleagues use the term
AI on things that are not AI speak up force them to
Define this is a powerful technological brand it's valuable in its own right and
the more they dilute it and pollute it the more quickly they do so the less progress you will make refine and secure
the data we're we saying this all week you're beginning to hear it make sure that the data that you hold that is
genuinely differential to your direct competitors and your perceived future competitors from your strategy make sure
that you're securing that and refining it so that it can be used to train those
differential AIS there's a new AI economic future that's emerging and it's emerging right
Unlock the value of AI
now but there's just one more thing we saved one data point for the very end
yeah who is it that CEOs most want to
unlock the value of AI it's
you and it's you and it's you you are the executive committee member that the
CEO is most turning to to unlock the value of generative AI you know with
digit what we saw was CEO cios kind of held back and then there was the
emergence of the chief digital officer role and some of you are the chief digital officer some of you are CIO and
CDO but don't let that new role that separate from you emerge
again yeah frame the economic future be bold lean in to the business reasoning
about how this incredibly powerful tool should be used to change your industry
and to change your business that is your option right now to lean in and do that
and if you don't do it in the next year somebody else will be brought in to do it to you all right so take that
opportunity be bold lean in I'd like to say for both of us and for all for the
for today and for all the times that we're on this beautiful stage with all the Fantastic people behind that screen doing everything for us
thank you for your time and
attention
