a good one a great one uh so I'm Rita Salam and uh welcome whoops welcome to
high business impact habits of top leaders who have data analytics and AI
responsibility uh so one of our most frequent inquiries in the data analytics and AI team that's where I sit in
Gartner is you know many of our leaders ask how can we become a data Centric
organization a reasonable question like how many of you aspire to be a data
Centric organization yeah most of you and I think that's great but I hope that I
convince you by the end of this 30 minutes that we not only want to be data Centric but we want to be first first
and foremost value Centric and the reason is that we see that that is a
habit of top performing leaders let me start with an analysis that we did so so
we had a hypothesis that companies treating data analytics and AI as strategically
important to their organization meaning it's aligned with the business would be
top Financial performers and so to test that hypothesis we analyzed the financial
performance of the global S&P 1200 companies on six key financial metrics
for the past nine years from 2014 through to Mid like half of year
2023 and we compared that performance again Financial evaluation metrics
against earnings calls and mentions and earnings calls of data analytics and AI
terms during that same same time period and the theory the sorry hypothesis was that given that companies have very
limited real estate on earnings calls that mentions on those earnings calls
would indicate strategic you know that this thing is strategic IC and so what we found is that consistently High
performing organizations meaning organizations that performed better than
their Industries on 80% of these Financial valuation metrics across that
entire 9 and a half year time frame mentioned data and an analytics terms
particularly AI 50% more than what we would call low performing organizations
those that performed worse than their industry across 80% of these metrics for 9 and a half years so you know what do
these leaders do what do the leaders in high performing organizations do that's what we'll talk about
today so uh data and analytics leaders first and foremost again clearly from
the analysis view data analytics AI as strategic to the organization's business
particularly in the world of AI so we we made a prediction to sort of represent that intent by 2026 more than quarter of
global organizations will have at least one top earning product that is based on
data analytics and Ai and that's particularly in the world of AI you're likely to have more and more sort of
analytics or AI incorporated into your product our service but in our analysis
we've of over 100 data and analytics and AI leaders we found that not all leaders
are the same right their focus uh some function more as business drivers as you
can see uh taking in customer focusing on Revenue product they often have a
seat at the executive table um others play more of an enabler role you know
focusing primarily on data foundation on operational efficiencies but the most
impactful of them really do both really do both um you really have to do both so
here are the top high impact habits of top Tech technology leaders that Focus
or have as their portfolio data analytics and AI um now you can either begin to develop them yourself you may
already be doing some of these which is great hopefully you'll get some new ideas to take the Habit to the next
level now for those of you who are in my session on Monday uh this will not be
new to you that was sort of the Mantra of the session on Monday that you need to create a business strategy that's
infused with data and analytics and AI not some separate data strategy that's
disconnected to the business I mean very clear it's core to the organization's success the value delivered is very
clear how the value is measured is very clear now what I'll focus on today not
so much that I didn't really focus on this in on Monday is the value story uh
skill so you know how do you do this right we talk a lot again about being data Centric but the data Centric
strategy by itself usually results in you being perceived as an enabler rather
than a driver as a cost center rather than Central to the business and so we need to build that value Centric data
native business strategy and again the strategy sort of the answers the question um you know why am I doing this
what am I doing how is this going to impact the business a lot of times when we talked to many many uh of our clients
about their data and analytic strategy and we say well what's your strategy they'll give a vendor name it's AWS it's
Microsoft it's Google or they often list a technology road map or a long list of initiatives we're working on
self-service we're working on governance we're working on Master data management and all of those things obviously are
great but how do they impact the business strategy is what we need to know whereas the operating model is how
do we succeed what are the capabilities that we need what are the te what's the technology what is the delivery model
what are the skill sets we need to deliver on the initiatives laid out in the strategy but High business impact
leaders importantly excel at telling a value story around their strategy and
operating model that make Business Leaders and their peers the heroes in their Value Story they're skilled at
connecting the initiatives that they're working on we call them value enablers uh to the specific stakeholder
priorities of the organization meaning how is how is that stakeholder going to be successful at the end of the day you
know how are they going to measure their own success their organization success how are they going to get paid their
bonus we need to know that and tie our initiatives to that thing and then T and
specifically then determine the specific outcomes in terms of impact on process
activity decisions in the organization lay that out very clearly and then
measure the return to the organization identify the kpis that actually measure
those out outcomes uh again we need to be talking about the initiatives we're working on in data and analytics and AI
in any technology actually this applies to anything in terms that our business peers our Executives our board can
relate to in terms of how it enables their success now for each of these um
examples or each of these habits I'll give you an example so the first one is urban urban shopping they do a great job
at this uh they this is a pseudonym for a retail chain uh in Europe and their
strategic business objectives are to really optimize revenue from the customer Journey they use marketing
analytics to do this to achieve that objective and so they had to figure out the business impact along that Journey
so they mapped out the journey and they identified the impact of analytics at each part of that process and they
identified kpis to measure the impact on the stakeholders so just if we whirl through this quickly they used analytics
to segment their customer base they identified a specific Persona and as a budget Shopper uh she she based on
analytics marketing analytics of historical uh Behavior Uh her her her de
demographics they present to her personalized promotions by email we all
get them um and so you know the more personalized the more precise the more accurate the better our data quality is
potentially that impacts Revenue per transaction an visits the website she completes her order but based on that we
may serve up to her you know additional things that she may like to buy again based on her demographics her purchasing
history Etc people who buy similar things again analytics impacting Revenue
per customer she may receive her order at home we don't map it out here but maybe there are supply chain analytics
that make sure she gets her package in two days that she paid for um and then you know she may visit the store there
are additional location analytics we may use uh Beacon data from smartphone locations to to present to her
promotions while she's in the store to help her um navigate the store to find the things she wants so you know very
useful Great Value Story that's very clear on how what we're doing in analytics around marketing and sales
impact the thing that this organization cares about so impact number two high
performing leaders who focus on data analytics and AI prioritize Talent
skills and change management we can deliver all the analytics in the world if people aren't
going to use that to impact how they change their behavior how they do their work how they make decisions you're not
going to realize value so and these the three things are interrelated again you
can't get value out of data and analytics unless you Leverage The analytics to change how people do things
um and so high performing organizations they're typically data and AI literate
meaning everyone knows how to use the data and the insights available to them
to intentionally affect how they work and how they make decisions they measure
the results they're accountable uh they're analytical they have critical thinking they challenge the status quo
uh they they think about using data on analytics and AI to
innovate within the organization uh they have communities of practice right where they impart
knowledge where they train where they deliver data liter where they impart governance policies and practices um
they're empathetic because they realize that hey change is hard and so how do you bring people along who may be
resistant but who need to leverage those insights to impact the business and so
value-driven organizations really do think and act differently with all of these traits um and they're constantly
planning for new uh capabilities new roles you know prompt engineering obviously is the biggie right now now
everybody in the business ultimately even if we roll we're rolling out co-pilots to just consumers everybody in
the business will need to have some additional skills to fully leverage you know generative AI or predictive AI or
other analytics that we may deliver to them of course developers will need a different level of skill than your CEO
or your VPS and your you know your Executives um you know and there'll be some roles that may go away I wonder you
know in the 60s as you all know there was a role called a computer right before we had computers there were
people who calculated you know long equations to send people to the Moon we saw that in uh you know movies but what
what role do you think will go away with generative AI or AI I wonder maybe it's business analyst right if everyone has
an AI chat bot to be able to analyze and understand what's going in the business going on in the business maybe we no
longer need that but we'll have new other roles that that emerge data coach data translator AI monitor AI ethicist
of course data ethicist will have other roles that we actually have predicted a neutral impact on jobs at Gartner um but
there will be some you know roles that we need more than others skills we have to develop and others that we will need
less over time so you you know High performing leaders keep an eye on that one so we know no roles will be changing
we know you'll have to keep up to date on skills but the one thing will be constant is the need to deliver Insight
Insight so we've got a couple case studies here the first one is into it and what I really like about this one is
that they don't just give users data or reports they don't just throw out that data catalog and say go at it you know
do what you want have fun even with rules that's really not the best way to get impact what they deliver is insights
uh you know what should users be deriving from the from the content
that's being delivered to them how should they use it in their jobs how should they use it to impact their jobs
so here you know they do quarterly reviews so past present and future they look at their month monthly updates and
then they do forecasts and they tell their consumers of this content what they should be doing with it the other
one that I really like is GFS security guangfa security and what they've done I
think they have what I would consider to be a best-in-class data literacy program uh where they make you know analytics a
skill for everyone but just they skill people different based on their role um
the program is designed to develop analytic capabilities that is very role specific um uh but they also use it to
identify top talent and so it has great attributes so they certainly they have
this in-house training it's online it's in classroom and importantly it's impli applied learning again teaching people
how they use the insights to impact their jobs they use competitions they
use rewards I'm a big fan of that to encourage particip ipation um they focus on analysis again how somebody uses this
to impact the business so they don't just teach tools they teach real world challenges from the business and they
measure the results they have certification as a way to make sure that people have the skills that they need uh
so I really like that one so how do but how do you reinforce change we all know that change management is is the rub
right that is how you make progress that's how you deliver value and we all know that that's you know a Monumental
task in most organizations so I I was an expert on a panel I was I was moderating
an expert panel a few years ago and somebody from the audience asked the panel um you know how long is does it
take for change to be realized and one of the other panelists was a CEO CEO of a public services
company and saidwell whenever the last person in the old regime dies he
literally said that um and you know of course I was thinking that's metaphorical I don't think he's going to be killing anybody but it does indicate
that you know change takes time it's hard we need to be patient we need to be again empathetic High performing leaders
here you know provide people again back to sort of the value stories to help them understand you know what's in it
for them they Inspire them to want to make the change again not easy um you
know one of the ways to bring people along is through stages to reinforce for
them sort of the from to because narrative you know again making it easy and possible for them to understand how
they make that transition reduce their friction um you know be clear that The New Normal yet may be scary but it's
going to be amazing for you reinforce it show them how to how to make the way and
here's the big one have and this is not just DNA have The Bravery to shut stuff down when it's time you know the old get
rid of the old stuff once for all clearly they'll be in some cases stuff that's just too risky you know to shut down if you got regulatory reporting
that you know we understand that but majority of things you know give it an end date and don't give people the
choice to remain in the past and you know what it's okay not to bring absolutely everyone along there'll be
folks that you just can't bring along and that's okay you know you can't please all the people all the time but
you know through these steps you'll hopefully you'll get people along and again measure them measure them um um so
high best habit number or high performing habit number three Drive business Innovation
leveraging emerging Trends use fast teams set audacious
goals now you've been inundated with Trends this week no doubt um you know
and by the way and I think we've we've sort of given you the general guidance that playing it save doesn't mean
ignoring Trends right doing anything even just to learn you you know if it aligns to your business can sometimes be
better than nothing so high performing data and analytics teams again they drive Innovation um sorry they um you
know are pretty quick to deliver value and if something isn't working they shut it in terms of a proof of concept they
they're pretty quick to shut it down you know over the past seven years you know AI has been I would say you know pretty
I wouldn't say mainstream but many forward-looking companies have started to do proof of Concepts and Implement at least predictive AI but it's not
uncommon to take six to 8 to n months to do a proof of concept on a Model to try
to say oh well I have value and then by the end of that you know long effort you find that H it has minimal impact so I
think some of the practices that we see you saw it in page group I'll talk a little bit about them in a second um 28
day cycle time for assessing if you should move forward you know doing a quick proof of value um you know again
having big goals not just oh we're going to improve by 5% but we are goal is to improve by 90% And if we get you know
halfway there it's it's it's good now here are our top trends for 2023 I am
not going to go over them Gareth hersel delivered them yesterday if you want to you know listen to that presentation
it's amazing um you know it it's you can listen to it on replay I think what you can see though is the trends align to
the six habits and you know many of them are not you wouldn't be surprising to you AI risk you know optim izing value
data sharing sustainability humans don't forget them platform and ecosystems which we'll talk about in a second um so
here's the example again I'll go in a little bit more detail about uh page group you know they again had a huge
really impactful initial uh I would say it's not really everyday AI because it's a core process you know recruiters a key
thing that they do is write job descriptions but you know they were it's really one of my favorite examples
because uh you know even though it is everyday AI they had a significant impact you know as as as as just to to
refresh they're a European job uh recruiter they've got 8,000 uh recruiters they were able to take the
time it takes to from writing a description from 90 to 5 minutes 20 to 90 minutes to 5 minutes but the real
story about this again is how they did it so they have a fast cycle Innovation
lab they call it their data lab where they assess new proof of concept in 28
days if they're not able to demonstrate value after 28 days they move on now in
some cases they'll say we'll reassess later like if it's a matter of a you know cost benefit type of problem but 28
days if they have to make decisions and people aren't in the office or they're on vacation their policy is to just make
decisions with who whomever is there on that day so very very good process and
again major goals the big thing for them the AI ready data so they had been
working on AI for the past seven years and they've been working on their data fabric for the past 4 and a half years
so that they credit the data fabric with them being able to get to the 5 minutes so they they were able to achieve a
certain amount of productivity gain from the generative AI piece but because they had to pull data from four different
systems that had never been integrated before to prepopulate these job descriptions they were really able to
get to that 5 minutes because of the a High ready data and they're going to be able to scale
it so uh High performing habit number four um build data analytics and AI
products not projects now there are three type sort of archetypes if you will for data products there's data as a
service there's sort of value stream insights um and there are essentially
information products and services that you might sell external to your Enterprise to create a revenue stream
again I think many of you will ultimately do that now that doesn't mean you need to turn everything into a
product but you know identify those product opportunities by really being again cult customer Centric be that
customer Advocate understand requirements again those C your customer may be internal they may be external if
you're over to the far right um basically you know promote agile
delivery practices as you would if you were a product manager creating a product that's going to have a skew
that's going to have to be updated that you're going to have to enhance over time that you're going to have to maintain uh the idea is you want to
create reusable data products that you know have a lot of traction across the organization not just one-offs you know
ideally if you can hire people with product management skills uh that's helpful and again I don't think this
just applies to data and analytics but we see that high performing data and analytics leaders uh do this
thing so case study again most companies if I'm being honest aren't taking the
data they have the unique data they have combining it potentially with other data that's external to create unique data
sets that they can monetize either by selling the data by itself or putting
analytics on top of it and creating some sort of analytic service um of course many use obviously data products to
create value again these reusable data sets but it's the same process um ZF
group actually does this they I think they offer a best-in-class uh approach to data product creation that you know
any company can adapt to sort of Kickstart the process so what they've did is to monetize the data that's
generated by its systems at first identified a business problem right where the data that they have could
absolutely map to um and then they gathered the data and created these these new products um making sure that
the business understood how to Market and sell uh these new products and of course they measure the impact and
adjust and evolve the produ product they enhance it they maintain it over time so
you may see it looks pretty similar to the infinity loop what they did essentially delivering a product
measuring the impact adjusting and evolving over time they they measure and
have kprs you know K kpis ok okrs to really measure the results of the impact
that this is having so really Best in Class this is actually a case study on gartner.com if you want to learn more
details about it so high business impact fact number five uh basically uh building a
composable data Foundation uh ecosystem that that essentially enables fast
response to Business and Technology changes now this is a representation of
a data and analytics Cloud ecosystem and what we know is that you know data and
analytics Cloud ecosystems versus on premises Platforms in the past support
more integrated workflows from data to analytics to to Ai and machine learning
to Applications that's sort of the value proposition of having you know a lot of the hyperscalers are really you know
touting versus you know stacks on premises Stacks in the past you could get like the set of capabilities that
you need the portfolio of capabilities but the integration was often very light discret products sort of integrated at
the invoice level often um but what you see now is that you know these sort of
ecosystems of capabilities prioritize workflow integration prioritize integration with isvs to fill in gaps
where they they may be light or to to integrate with your existing environment
and so you know I think what's important here is again AI ready data AI ready
analytics is a foundation and I think we're at a point where we really can't kick that data can down the road so this
becomes a very important foundation again look at page group and many of of our clients I think are really there at
having made that sort of investment even if it's parallel to as you're developing
these AIU I know many of you will say well I'm not going to just you know develop this all at you know take three
years to develop my data ready Foundation no you have to deliver value now so you might have to do it sort of
in parallel to high value use cases again AI ready data this is a really I
love this slide and we we talk a lot about this in our team where you have traditional data management
practices and those are amazing but AI requires sort of additional capabilities
whether it's a labeling and bias mitigation and different types of security and even if you're moving into
generative AI with Enterprise search different types of Technology like embeddings and Vector databases Etc data
which is data enrichment knowledge graphs at the same time people building out these models typically focus on
model accuracy how many models do I deploy in production they need also to get a sense for data and a you know the
importance of AI ready data um and and so we have to have a much more integrated process um definitely High
performing leaders put in place processes to scale because it's very different to do something in production
versus scaling it and maintaining it over time particularly when we're talking about AI you need data Ops and
devops and AI Ops and mlops particularly you know processes that allow you to
scale over time and particularly incorporate new technology as it evolves which we'll certainly see with
generative AI um great example here put in place a framework uh that allows you
to again model this model and scale operations Fidelity has done a great job here they've managed to increase speed
to production by you know double the speed you know essentially reduce the time by you know 100% um and they've
been able to resolve product issues um and and reduce the time it takes by 80%
by putting in place these kind of processes so last one I'll be really quick governance and unfortunately this
is probably one of the more important ones right data and analytics leaders uh
AI leaders treat governance and risk management as an essential value driver
right there's nothing more important here um you know where you need to articulate foundational investments in
terms of in Terms that business peers can can understand now usually when we mention governance to the business what
happens have any idea you probably have seen it eyes glaze
over they may roll in the back of their heads they may even fall asleep and they
may just say no you're trying to control me and so we don't want that but there is a way to talk about how governance is
so critical to most of most every use case that we're delivering and we need to tell that story um and by the way it
doesn't mean that we have to set up this big upfront governance practice it doesn't mean that we you know catalog
everything before we can start day one it doesn't mean that we enlist data stewards before we even you know think
about analytics it has to be a much more agile uh process and the way I view it
and the way I think we have to sell it is governance is a team sport it is essentially the Enterprise trust
initiative so I almost don't use governance with business people I say you like to be trusted you want to be trusted externally you want to have an
excellent reputation then um you need to have governance and and that's how we
need to sell it's it is the Enterprise trust initiative everyone wants to be trusted so I'm going to just focus on
this one given we just have a little bit of time so this one happens to be an AI one it's a great example uh again AI
governance they are this in this case axen is a global leader in Connected Public Services um they've assembled an
independent AI board board which I think is really interesting the AI ethics board really helps them in the
development of their AI power devices their development team has access to them their Ombudsman has access to them
and this board sort of over represents civil liberties uh privacy voices and
concerns it shares its feedback with axen but also publicly so axen credits
this board with really um helping them with their AI strategy they feel like
it's a crucial part of their sort of AI First Development strategy so as a
reminder we covered you know business bu build a value Centric da data and analytics and a native
strategy uh prioritize Talent skills change management as core competencies
again you can't deliver value if you don't have the right skills if people don't know how to use the analytics that
you're making available to them uh build of course Drive Innovation by leveraging
emerging Trends one of the aspects of an excellent strategy is that you
incorporate Trends and drivers in that strategy many many strategy uh documents
that we review don't have that set set audacious goals think about fast Innovation cycle
times uh build products not projects build a scalable
composable agile data analytics and AI ecosystem and Foundation focus on AI
ready data focus on processes that allow you to scale not just do proof of
Concepts and then finally treat governance and risk management as a key value driver as it is so I'll just leave
you with one question um you know given all of this maybe you can think about what type of leader will you be like
hopefully you will be both a business driver and an enabler to help your organization shift from being data
Centric to being value Centric so thank thank you for listening I'm really excited about you know you all being
here with us this week hopefully you have a safe safe trip home and and enjoy the rest of the conference if you're
going to stay for another session thank [Applause] you
